# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:
<p>My journey in electronics has been defined by a deep interest in VLSI design, digital Electronics and communication.

During my recent Training at NIELIT, Gorakhpur, Where I use CADENCE tools, to enhance my skills in circuit design. One of my notable projects, the Ultra-Wideband Bandpass Filter, reflects my passion for innovation, with its application-oriented design garnering recognition at international workshops.

Beyond my technical expertise, I'm proficient in Python, C/C++, and various web development technologies. My certifications in remote sensing, data analytics, and digital marketing underscore my commitment to continuous growth.

Outside of academics, I actively contribute as a Subject Matter Expert at Chegg and find joy in playing badminton and volunteering for various college events. With a diverse skill set and a drive for innovation, I'm eager to make meaningful contributions in the field of electronics engineering.</p>
